The euclidean plane usually has $x$ and $ y $ as standard variables.

block displaymath: use `{{$` and `}}$` to enclose a displaymath environment. 
The opening syntax must be on a single line, as the closing one. The contents are to be written on one or more lines in-between, e.g.:

text text
{{$
\sum_{i=1}^N a_i^2 = \infty
}}$
text text

block environments: other block environments are supported in addition to displaymath. These include gather, align, cases, etc.. To use them, use %% placeholders after {{$ when you open your math block, e.g.:

{{$%equation*%
bla bla
}}$

Vimwiki and MathJax are smart enough to allow for whitespaces at the beginning or end of the line. However, their use is discouraged.

Note: block environments are mostly used for writing several lines of math after one another. This can be obtained e.g. via the align LaTeX environment:

{{$%align%
formula1 &= result1 \\
formula2 &= result2
}}$
